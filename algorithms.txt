- Algorithm 3 - Wavelet like Algorithm 4, but was done using grayscale comparison instead of separately for RGB channels. ALl 3 channels for each pixel always from same image in set.
- Algorithm 4 - our wavelet algorithm, our alignment. comparison and assignment of separate RGB channels.
- Algorithm 6 - cmcguiness Laplacian with our alignment.
